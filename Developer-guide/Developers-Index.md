### Contributing to the Gluster community
-------------------------------------

Are you itching to send in patches and participate as a developer in the
Gluster community? Here are a number of starting points for getting
involved. We don't require a signed contributor license agreement or
copyright assignment, but we do require a "signed-off-by" line on each
code check-in.

Workflow
--------

-   [Simplified Developer Workflow](./Simplified-Development-Workflow.md)
    - A simpler and faster intro to developing with GlusterFS, than the
    doc below.
-   [Developer Workflow](./Development-Workflow.md) - this tells
    you about our patch requirements, tools we use, and more. Required
    reading if you want to contribute code.

Compiling Gluster
-----------------

-   [Compiling RPMS](./Compiling-RPMS.md) - Step by step
    instructions for compiling Gluster RPMS
-   [Building GlusterFS](./Building-GlusterFS.md) - How to compile
    Gluster from source code. Including instructions for Ubuntu.

Developing
----------

-   [Projects](./Projects.md) - Ideas for projects you could
    create
-   [EasyFix Bugs](./Easy-Fix-Bugs.md) - Easy to fix bugs of
    GlusterFS. One of the best place to start contributing to GlusterFS.
-   [Fixing issues reported by tools for static code
    analysis](./Fixing-issues-reported-by-tools-for-static-code-analysis.md)
    - This is a good starting point for developers to fix bugs in
    GlusterFS project.
-   [Backport Wishlist](./Backport-Wishlist.md) - Problems fixed
    in the master branch might need to get fixed in stable release
    branches too.
-   [Backport Guidelines](./Backport-Guidelines.md) describe the steps that
    branches too.
